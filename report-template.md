# Module 12 Report Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the accuracy of a model that uses historical lending activity from peer-to-peer lending services to build a model.

* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.

The financial information used in this analysis is historical lending activity to predict the credit worthiness of borrowers. 

* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).

The variables that were being analysed and predicted are: Actual Healthy Loans (low-risk), Actual Non-Healthy Loans (high-risk), Predicted Healthy Loans (low-risk), Predicted Non-Healthy Loans (high-risk). A logistic regression model was used to predict the values above. 

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

   * Accuracy Score: The macro average is 92% for healthy loan applicants, weighted average is 99% for risky loan applicants. 
   * Precision Score: Score was 100% for healthy loan applicants and 87% for risky loan applicants. 
   * Recall Score: Score was 99% for healthy loan applicants and 91% for risky loan applicants. 

   The overall accuracy was 99%. 

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. 

In conclusion, the logistic regression model is recommended to predict credit worthiness and as a machine learning model demonstrates analysis of a subject really well. There is an overall 99% accuracy demonstrated which shows the reliability of the model.
